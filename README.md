# Dynamic Programming Problems

This README file categorizes dynamic programming (DP) problems into different groups based on their characteristics. Each group focuses on specific aspects of DP problems, making it easier to understand and approach these challenges. The problems are primarily sourced from LeetCode.

## Group 1 (Warmup)

üöÄ Basic questions to get a feel of DP.

- [Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/) - Linear Time
- [N-th Tribonacci Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-th-tribonacci-number/) - Linear Time
- [Perfect Squares](https://leetcode.com/problems/perfect-squares/) - (Maybe)

## Group 2 (Linear Sequence, Linear Time, Constant Transition)

üìà DP solutions involve solving subproblems on every prefix of the array.

- [Min Cost Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-climbing-stairs/) - Linear Time
- [Minimum Time to Make Rope Colorful](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-make-rope-colorful/)
- [House Robber](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/)
- [Decode Ways](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-ways/)
- [Minimum Cost for Tickets](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-for-tickets/)
- [Solving Questions with Brainpower](https://leetcode.com/problems/solving-questions-with-brainpower/)

## Group 3 (On Grids)

üß© DP tables have the same dimensions as the grid, with states related to grid cells.

- [Unique Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/)
- [Unique Paths II](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-ii/)
- [Minimum Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-sum/)
- [Count Square Submatrices with All Ones](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-square-submatrices-with-all-ones/)
- [Maximal Square](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-square/)
- [Dungeon Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/dungeon-game/)

## Group 4 (Two Sequences, O(NM) Style)

üîÑ DP[i][j] relates to problems solved on prefixes of two sequences.

- [Longest Common Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/)
- [Uncrossed Lines](https://leetcode.com/problems/uncrossed-lines/) (Longest Common Subsequence)
- [Minimum ASCII Delete Sum for Two Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-ascii-delete-sum-for-two-strings/)
- [Edit Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/)
- [Distinct Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/distinct-subsequences/)
- [Shortest Common Supersequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-common-supersequence/)

## Group 5 (Interval DP)

üï∞Ô∏è DP problems are solved on every single interval (subarray) of the array.

- [Longest Palindromic Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-subsequence/)
- [Stone Game VII](https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game-vii/)
- [Palindromic Substrings](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindromic-substrings/)
- [Minimum Cost Tree from Leaf Values](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-tree-from-leaf-values/) (Hard to See Interval)
- [Strange Printer](https://leetcode.com/problems/strange-printer/) (Hard)
- [Burst Balloons](https://leetcode.com/problems/burst-balloons/) (Hard)

## Group 6 (Linear Sequence Transition)

üåü DP problems are solved on every prefix of the array with transitions from every index j < i.

- [Count Number of Teams](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-teams/)
- [Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/)
- [Partition Array for Maximum Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-array-for-maximum-sum/)
- [Largest Sum of Averages](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-sum-of-averages/)
- [Filling Bookcase Shelves](https://leetcode.com/problems/filling-bookcase-shelves/)

## Group 7 (Knapsack-Like)

üéí DP state is similar to the classical knapsack problem.

- [Partition Equal Subset Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-equal-subset-sum/)
- [Number of Dice Rolls with Target Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-dice-rolls-with-target-sum/)
- [Combination Sum IV](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-iv/)
- [Ones and Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/ones-and-zeroes/)
- [Coin Change](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/)
- [Coin Change II](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change-ii/)
- [Target Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/target-sum/)
- [Last Stone Weight II](https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight-ii/)
- [Profitable Schemes](https://leetcode.com/problems/profitable-schemes/) (Hard)
